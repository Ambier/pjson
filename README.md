pjson
=====

Like `python -mjson.tool` but with moar colors (and less conf)

###Usage

    ⚡ echo '{"json":"obj"}' | pjson
    {
      "json": "obj"
    }
    
###Install

Just copy and paste this:

    curl https://raw.github.com/igorgue/pjson/master/pjson > ~/bin/pjson

If it doesn't work run this:

    ⚡ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

For zsh bros, though, they might already know this:

    ⚡ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
